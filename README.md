## Goals

The survey was created out of our desire to:

* Welcome all members regardless of race, sex, age, skill level, and economic background. Be inclusive
* Help each other level up in our programming skills.
* Help each other advance in our careers.
* Motivate each other to be more active in participating in the community.

## Next Steps
